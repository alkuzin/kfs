 * variable argument list, that is, the last argument of which
 * the calling function knows the type.
 *
 * Because the address of this argument may be used in the
 * va_start() macro, it should not be declared as a register

/**
 * @brief This macro expands to an expression that has the type
 * and value of the next argument in the call.
 *
 * The argument ap is the va_list ap initialized by va_start().
 * Each call to va_arg() modifies ap  so that the next call
 * returns the next argument. The argument type is a type name
 * specified so that the type of a pointer to an object that has
 * the specified type can be obtained simply by adding a * to type.
 *
 * The first use of the va_arg() macro after that of the
 * va_start() macro returns the argument after last. Successive
 * invocations return the values of the remaining arguments.
 *
 * If there is no next argument, or if type is not compatible
 * with the type of the actual next argument (as promoted accord‚Äê
 * ing to the default argument promotions), random errors will
 * occur.
 *
 * If ap is passed to a function that uses va_arg(ap,type), then
 * the value of ap is undefined after the return of that function.
 *
 * @param [in] v - arguments list.
 * @param [in] l - number of arguments.

 * last argument, followed by the same number of va_arg() invocations
 * that was used to reach the current state of src.

 * @param [in] v - arguments list.
 * @param [in] l - number of arguments.

 * Multiple traversals of the list, each bracketed by va_start()
 * and va_end() are possible. va_end() may be a macro or a function.
